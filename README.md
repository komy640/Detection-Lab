# Soc Home Lab Using Splunk

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- In-depth knowledge of SIEM principles and real-world implementation.
- Expertise in examining and interpreting security logs.
- Ability to detect and analyze attack patterns and indicators.
- Improved understanding of network protocols and system vulnerabilities.
- Strengthened analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- SIEM (Splunk Server) – Used for log ingestion and analysis.
- Splunk Universal Forwarder – Installed on endpoints to forward logs.
- Sysmon (System Monitor) – Configured on Windows machines for detailed event logging.
- Wireshark – Used for network traffic analysis.
- Kali Linux – Used as an attacker machine for testing security defenses.
